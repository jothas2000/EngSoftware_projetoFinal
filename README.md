Game development for people with intellectual and learning difficulties developed in HTML, CSS, JS and integration with Database (Incomplete)

To run, you need the Xampp to run the local server, then you add all these files to the htdocs folder on C:\xampp\htdocs, and open the index.html to start the game, the develop of this ended before some addons, so it is very incomplete
